# Fit & Bit  

##### Version 1.0  

Fit & Bit is a clock face for the Fitbit Ionic smart watch. Its retro LCD look, 
inspired by Nintendo's Game And Watch portable games, keeps an emphasis on stats 
offered at a glance. It also features a little athlete running with you, wherever 
you might be headed!  

It's also open source (because I know how much that can help beginners)!  

### Features

🔋 Battery level bar divided into thirds  
❤ Heart rate in BPM that updates every 5 seconds  
🏃🏽‍♀️🔥 Steps and calories stats featured clearly
